## Browser Compatibility

TinyMCE uses advanced JavaScript and tries to be as smart as possible when it comes to different browsers. The main focus is on Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari.

If a browser is not listed on this page it doesn't mean TinyMCE won't work, it does mean however that TinyMCE may not have been fully tested on the unlisted browser. To determine compatibility with an unlisted browser, try out the examples on our website.

Please use the [issues tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues) to submit bugs on the listed browsers only.

|Browser | Windows | Mac | GNU/Linux |
|:------:|:-------:|:---:|:---------:|
|Chrome  | OK      | OK  | OK |
|Firefox | OK      | OK  | OK |
|Edge    | OK      | N/A | N/A |
|IE 11   | OK      | N/A | N/A |
|IE 10   | OK      | N/A | N/A |
|IE 9    | OK *    | N/A | N/A |
|IE 8    | OK *    | N/A | N/A |
|Safari  | N/A     | OK  | N/A |

### Notes

> TinyMCE's [image upload feature]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure/file-image-upload//) and the [imagetools]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/image-tools/) plugin are not compatible with IE8 and IE9.


## Next step

We're almost done. Last, but certainly not least, are TinyMCE's [developer support options](../get-support).
