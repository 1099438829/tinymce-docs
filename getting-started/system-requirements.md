## Browser Compatibility

TinyMCE uses advanced JavaScript and tries to be as smart as possible when it comes to different browsers. The main focus is on Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari. If a browser is not listed on this page, that doesn't mean TinyMCE won't work, however TinyMCE may not have been fully tested on the unlisted browser. To determine compatibility with an unlisted browser, try out the examples on our website.

Please use the Tracker system to submit bugs on the listed browsers only.

|Browser | Windows | Mac | GNU/Linux |
|:------:|:-------:|:---:|:---------:|
|Chrome  | OK      | OK  | OK |
|Firefox | OK      | OK  | OK |
|Edge    | OK      | N/A | N/A |
|IE 11   | OK      | N/A | N/A |
|IE 10   | OK      | N/A | N/A |
|IE 9    | OK *    | N/A | N/A |
|IE 8    | OK *    | N/A | N/A |
|Safari  | N/A     | OK  | N/A |

### Notes

`*` TinyMCE's image upload feature and the [imagetools]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/image-tools/) plugin are not compatible with IE8 and IE9.


## Next Steps

We're almost done. Last, but certainly not least, are TinyMCE's [developer support options](../getting-support).
