## Default Visual Editor in Wordpress

A slimmed down version of TinyMCE is the default "Visual Editor" in WordPress.

## TinyMCE Advanced

[TinyMCE Advanced](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/) is a WordPress plugin built by [Andrew Ozz](https://profiles.wordpress.org/azaozz/) that will let you add, remove, and arrange the buttons that are shown on the Visual Editor toolbar. It includes 15 plugins for TinyMCE that are automatically enabled or disabled depending on what buttons are chosen.

**Some of the features added by this plugin**

* Support for creating and editing tables
* More options when inserting lists
* Search and Replace in the editor
* Ability to set Font Family and Font Size

With this plugin you will also be able to enable the TinyMCE menu. It is a convenient way to access a lot of features that are not used frequently.
