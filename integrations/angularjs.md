## ui-tinymce directive

There is an excellent and actively maintained [AngularJS project on GitHub](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-tinymce). Here's the [contribute.md](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-tinymce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like contribute to the project.

> The ui-tinymce directive plays nicely with the ng-model directive such as ng-required.

> If you add the ng-model directive to same the element as ui-tinymce then the text in the editor is automatically synchronized with the model value.

> The ui-tinymce directive stores the configuration options as specified in the TinyMCE documentation and expects the model value to be a html string or raw text, depending on whether raw is true (default value is false).
