title: Using CDN
---

The easiest way to get started with TinyMCE is to use our CDN. Simply include this line of code in your HTML page to get started.

```html
<script src="//tinymce.cachefly.net/4.0/tinymce.min.js"></script>
```

While we're at it a big shout out to [Cachefly](http://www.cachefly.com/) who sponsors the CDN hosting of TinyMCE.

#### Additional Information About Using the CDN

There are a few special things you need to take in consideration when using the CDN version, first of all, if you wish to use any local plugins (like [MoxieManager](http://www.moxiemanager.com/?_ga=1.50414505.1485359142.1444845779) for example) you need to load them using the new option called:

[external_plugins](http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Configuration:external_plugins)

Also, if you wish to use a custom language, you need to enter the location of the language file into the new option called:

[language_url](http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Configuration:language_url)
