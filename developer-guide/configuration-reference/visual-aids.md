# Configuration of Visual Aids

These settings apply to the content of the editor while it is being edited. An example of a visual aid that is available is the light grey, dotted border that is applied to tables when the border property is set to "0". These settings can change the classes that are applied to visual aids in addition to determining whether they appear at all.

{% include configuration/visual-aids/visual.md %}
{% include configuration/visual-aids/visual-table-class.md %}
{% include configuration/visual-aids/visual-anchor-class.md %}
