The [Linkchecker plugin]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/linkchecker/) and [Media Embed plugin]({{ site.baseurl }}/plugins/mediaembed/) provide link checking and conversion of a URL to an embeddable snippet of code capabilities to the editor. These are premium upgrades that are included in paid subscription plans of TinyMCE including [TinyMCE Enterprise](http://www.tinymce.com/pricing/).

These plugins require an additional [server-side component]({{ site.baseurl }}/enterprise/server/) to be installed and configured.

You'll also need to do some [Linkchecker server configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}/enterprise/check-links-and-embed-media/linkchecker-server/) and [Media Embed server configuration]({{ site.baseurl }}/enterprise/check-links-and-embed-media/mediaembed-server/).

> **Important note:** The Linkchecker and Media Embed server currently do not support integration with IBM WebSphere Application Server.
