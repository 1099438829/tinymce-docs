## moxiemanager Control

The moxiemanager Control enables users to insert files located externally to the editor (e.g. on their client desktop) into their document.

Note: **moxiemanager** is an application separate from TinyMCE and not a "plugin". However, being built by the team behind TinyMCE it has tight integration with the editor via a toolbar control.

**moxiemanager** is a paid addition to TinyMCE. Learn more at [http://www.moxiemanager.com/](http://www.moxiemanager.com/)
