## end_container_on_empty_block

This option allows you to to split the current container block element if the enter key is pressed inside an empty inner block element.

An example of this setting is as follows:

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: "textarea",  // change this value according to your html
  end_container_on_empty_block: true
});
```
