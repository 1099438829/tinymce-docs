<p>TinyMCE provides a number of configuration options enabling you to integrate it tightly with your application. &nbsp;This guide will explore the most commonly used configuration options to help you get the most out of your new TinyMCE installation.</p>
<p>Once you've added the TinyMCE script to your page, there are three main aspects of configuration you need to consider - selector, plugins and toolbar configuration options.</p>
<h3>Selector Configuration Option</h3>
<p>Possibly the most important configuration option for your TinyMCE integration. &nbsp;The <a href="/wiki.php/Configuration:selector">selector configuration option</a> allows you to use CSS selector syntax to determine which elements on the page should be editable through TinyMCE.</p>
<h3>Plugins Configuration Option</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="/wiki.php/Configuration:plugins">plugins configuration option</a>&nbsp;allows you to enable functionality within the editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, NO plugins are loaded. &nbsp;As there are several significant TinyMCE plugins that provide key features it is important that you consider which plugins you wish to include.</p>
<p>Specify which plugins you would like to use by providing this configuration option a&nbsp;comma or space separated string, or an array of strings.</p>
<p>The full list of plugins is available&nbsp;<a href="/wiki.php/Plugins">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Toolbar Configuration Option</h3>
<p>In most TinyMCE integrations it's desirable to change the toolbar configuration to suit your needs. &nbsp;By default TinyMCE provides a basic set of editing tools on the toolbar and it is recommended that you adapt the toolbar configuration to match your requirements.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki.php/Configuration:toolbar">toolbar configuration option</a> allows you to choose which items appear on the toolbar as well as the order and grouping of toolbar items.</p>
<p>Alternatively, multiple toolbars can be used by specifying multiple toolbar options suffixed with a number ie. "toolbar1", "toolbar2", "toolbar3" etc. &nbsp;If multiple toolbars are used, the original toolbar option will be ignored.</p>
<p>The full list of items that may be used on toolbars is available <a href="/wiki.php/Controls">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Advanced Configuration</h3>
<p>Using the configuration options above you'll be able to instantiate TinyMCE and perform the initial customizations to match your editor requirements. &nbsp;TinyMCE has many many other configuration options available that enable further customization and extension of the editor.</p>
