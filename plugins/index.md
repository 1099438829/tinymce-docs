The real power of TinyMCE's functionality is in its (so-called) plugins. Plugins typically extend the default editor functionality or add new functionality. For example, the Advanced List (`advlist`) plugin adds extra options to the toolbar's existing list controls, while the Code plugin (`code`) adds an entirely new control.

The plugins listed below are included in the standard TinyMCE package, such as the one served via the CDN, but they are not activated.

It's important to note that some plugins have advanced configuration requirements, in addition to including the plugin's name as a value in the `plugins` key. These requirements are explained in any plugin with advanced configuration options.
