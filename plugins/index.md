The real power of TinyMCE's functionality is in its (so-called) plugins. Plugins typically extend the default editor functionality or add new functionality. For example, the Advanced List (`advlist`) plugin adds extra options to the toolbar's existing list controls, while the Code (`code`) plugin adds an entirely new control.

The plugins listed below are included in the standard TinyMCE package, such as the one served via the CDN, but they are not activated.

It's important to note that some plugins have advanced configuration requirements, in addition to including the plugin's name as a value in the `plugins` key. These requirements are clearly explained in any plugin with advanced configuration options.

> Note that TinyMCE's plugins are not actually part of the TinyMCE "core". They are separate components. In fact, if you use the [custom package](http://www.tinymce.com/download/custom_package.php) download option you're able to exclude all of the free plugins built by the TinyMCE team.
