title: MoxieManager File & Image Management Plugin
---

The MoxieManager File & Image Management Plugin enables users to insert files located externally to the editor (e.g. on their client desktop) into their document.

Note: **MoxieManager** is an application separate from TinyMCE and not just a "plugin". However, being built by the team behind TinyMCE it has tight integration with the editor via a toolbar control.

**MoxieManager** is a paid addition to TinyMCE. It can be purchased separately or included in TinyMCE Enterprise subscription.
