TinyMCE is an open source software project and we encourage developers to contribute patches and code for us to include in the main package of TinyMCE. However there are a few rules and limitations when doing so and this page list them.

## Basic Rules

Contributed code will be licensed under the LGPL license but not limited to LGPL.

Copyright notices will be changed to Ephox Corporation. But contributors will get credit for their work.

All third party code will be reviewed, tested and possible modified before being released.

These basic rules makes it possible for us to earn a living of the TinyMCE project but it also ensures that the code remains open source and under the LGPL license.


## How to Contribute

The TinyMCE source code is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce). Through Github you can submit pull requests and log new bugs and feature requests.
